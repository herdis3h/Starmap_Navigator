### 1. Install Node.js

Ensure you have **Node.js 14+** installed on your system.

### 2. Create an Environment File

Create a **`.env.local`** file in the root directory and add the following keys (adjust as needed for your local setup):

NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
API_SECRET="1234"

# Application Architecture & Technology Choices

I chose **Next.js** for its **SSR benefits** and seamless **React integration**, making it the best fit for the UI.

For **3D rendering**, I went with **@react-three/fiber** due to my experience with **Three.js** and its strong community support. To streamline development, I also used **React Drei**, which provides helpful utilities for @react-three/fiber. For **smooth animations**, I integrated **React Spring**, which enhances interactions and speeds up development.

Additionally, **@react-three/fiber supports accessibility**, which I found to be a great feature.

The **API data** is loaded from a **secure route**, authenticated with a **bearer token**, ensuring safe and efficient access.

To keep development **efficient**, I started with a **boilerplate** to speed up the setup process.

# Design Decisions & User Experience Considerations

Since this is a **star system galaxy**, **scalability** was a key focus. With the expectation that **thousands of stars and planets** might be added in the future, **performance optimization** was crucial.

To ensure smooth performance, I chose to **render the stars within the GPU** using **shaders**. This allows for **efficient rendering** without impacting performance. I experimented with **fragment shaders** to create a **minimal yet realistic star effect**.

For the **planets and distant star systems** that form the background, I used **Sparkles from Drei** to **dynamically populate the environment**, adding **depth and atmosphere** to the galaxy.

To make the galaxy feel more **organic**, I **randomized the colors** of stars and planets and ensured that planets were placed within their **relevant star system**, as defined in the JSON data.

# Potential Future Features & Improvements

### ðŸ”§ **Refactoring**

- Split up the **Planet component**, making it **more modular** and **easier to test**.

### ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Enhancements**

- Spend time **refining the color palette** and designing a more immersive **background** for the planets.
- I started working on a **shader-based aurora borealis effect**, but it needs **further refinement** to feel right.

### ðŸŽ¥ **Camera Improvements**

- Enhance **camera movement**, especially when clicking on stars.
- Ideally, users would be able to **zoom in and explore each planet** within a star system, making the experience more **interactive**.

### **State management**

- Add state management once needed
